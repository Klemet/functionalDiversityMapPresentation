# functionalDiversityMapPresentation
A presentation about making functional diversity maps with the mFD package made in impress.js.

This presentation started by using the template of presentations made by [KhaledMohamedP](https://github.com/KhaledMohamedP/dcPrecent). I've updated several things and tweaked the style and content to obtain what I wanted.

The presentation uses [impress.js](https://impress.js.org/), [markdown.js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).
