# functionalDiversityMapPresentation
A presentation about making functional diversity maps with the mFD package made in impress.js.

This presentation started by using the template of presentations made by [KhaledMohamedP](https://github.com/KhaledMohamedP/dcPrecent). I've updated several things and tweaked the style and content to obtain what I wanted.
